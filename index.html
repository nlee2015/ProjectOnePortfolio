            <p>Nicholas was born and raised in San Francisco and is continuing college in the city. This is his third year of college but his second year at SFSU after he transferred 
                last year from the University of San Francisco. He is currently majoring in Visual Communication Design after changing from a history major in his first year. Originally, 
                he wanted to major in something similar to graphic design, however he made a sudden decision to major in history during his senior year of high school as he liked learning 
                about history from a young age. Even though drawing was one his favorite hobbies as a kid, he decided that history might have been a better choice for him at that time. However 
                spending time as a history major during his first year made him realize that he was not as passionate as he thought he was with history which led him to rediscover his passion for design.</p>
            <p>Nicholas grew up in North Beach and usually frequents the surrounding neighborhoods of Chinatown, Russian Hill, the Marina, Fisherman’s Wharf, and more. Growing up, Nicholas 
                immersed himself in his Chinese American identity as he attended a Chinese language school for 12 years, eventually graduating with a diploma and high literacy in the language. 
                He learned how to read and write in Mandarin in addition to learning Chinese calligraphy. One of his passions and hobbies has also been practicing kung fu and lion dancing from a young age. 
                He has participated yearly in street fairs in San Francisco’s Chinatown, San Francisco’s Chinese New Year Parade, yearly kung fu tournaments, and more. Above is a picture of Nicholas from a 
                kung fu tournament that was held last summer.</p>
            <p>A few more fun facts about Nicholas is that he used to play the cello in his middle school orchestra in addition to running for his middle school’s track and field team.</p>
