            <h2>Three sources I find for inspiration</h2>
                <h3><a href="https://www.instagram.com/glenmurakami/?hl=englen">Glen Murakami</a></h3>
                <img src="img/murakami.jpeg" alt="Glen Murakami's artwork consisting of all of the Teen Titans protaginists leaping 
                forward coming towards the screen"
                <br>
                    <p>He was a producer of many super hero oriented cartoons shown on Cartoon Netowrk in the 2000s. 
                        His art style incorprated features of anime and other Japanese elements which are shown in the cartoon of Teen Titans.
                        I really loved how those charcters were drawn as the characters felt and looked realistic while still maintaining that cartoon quality.
                        His is art style quickly influenced my drawing style as I started to influence those elements.</p>


                <h3><a href="https://sfneon.org/">San Francisco Neon</a></h3>
                <img src ="img/sfneon.png" alt="San Franciscoâ€™s Chinatown Li Po neon lantern sign lit up at night 
                with red neon tubes outlining the vertical lantern sign."
                <br>
                    <p>This organization restores San Francisco's old neon signs along with preserving
                        the neon history of San Francisco. They help bring new life to old neon 
                        signs bringing back vibrance and liveliness into that area where it once lit up which I find inspiring.
                         I think neon signs are very visually appealing as the designs illuminates the night sky which I hope one day my 
                        designs can do the same.</p> 


                <h3><a href="https://www.opensfhistory.org/index.php">OpensfHistory</a></h3>
                <img src ="img/opensfhistory.png" alt="1963 view of San Francisco Chinatown's Grant Avenue at night 
                from Sacramento looking towards Pine street. Neon signs light the buildings with lanterns strung across the buildings over the streets."
                <br>
                    <p>This organization preserves San Francisco history through their website where there's access to historical photos of 
                        San Francisco that everyone can search for. Being interested with the history of San 
                        Francisco and even being a former history major, I like to look into the past to find new ideas as I think history 
                        and the past influences the present and shapes how we think.</p>
